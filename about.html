        <h1>About This Project</h1>
        <p>For my project, I used Hinge data as a foundation to explore how people express themselves and connect online. In a unique approach, Iâ€™ve chosen to represent the data visually through the metaphor of a mouth, embodying the notion of conversations and dialogues that start with simple words but often carry deeper, complex meanings.</p>
        
        <p>Through a blend of text, visuals, and data-driven insights, this project transforms raw, numerical data into a narrative about online relationships, connections, and self-representation. Each visual element, from the shape of the mouth to the movement of the text, aims to capture the multifaceted nature of these interactions and the emotions behind them.</p>
        
        <p>By reimagining data in this way, I invite viewers to reflect on their own experiences in digital spaces and the layers of communication that define modern connection.</p>
        
        <p>Each video holds a different part of my data, so clicking on them will show unique displays!</p>

        <p>This project features a single, immersive video that takes viewers into the intricate world inside a single tooth. Once inside, you encounter a network of tooth nerves, each one representing a conversation Iâ€™ve had with people on Hinge. These nerves, like pathways of connection, are woven together from words and exchanges, symbolizing the sensory experience of each interaction.</p>
        
        <p>Just as tooth nerves carry sensations, these conversations contribute to the overall feel of my dating journey. Each nerve represents a different facet of connection, building an emotional landscape that is both personal and universal in the dating experience. Through this representation, I explore how individual dialogues shape both perception and intimacy within online interactions.</p>

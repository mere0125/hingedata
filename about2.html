        <h1>1</h1>
        <p>This project presents four sequential videos, each crafted in p5.js to visualize the layered data collected from my Hinge interactions. The sequence begins with a full view of a mouth and gradually zooms in closer with each video until we’re focused on the detail of a single tooth. This progression reflects both the intimacy of digital interactions and the personal data that shapes them.</p>
        
        <p>Each video uniquely integrates text and data, transforming my Hinge experiences into a visual narrative. In the first video, the shape of the mouth is constructed from the exact words people used to open their conversations with me, capturing the energy and curiosity of those initial exchanges.</p>
        
        <p>The following three videos move beyond first impressions, using color to reveal demographic diversity within my interactions. Each color corresponds to different categories such as race, gender, and sexual orientation, with proportions that accurately represent these elements in my dataset. The images in these videos grow increasingly detailed as we zoom in, symbolizing a journey from surface-level exchanges to a deeper understanding of connection and diversity in online spaces.</p>
        
        <p>By translating data into visual form, this project invites viewers to explore the layers of communication and identity that shape digital relationships. It’s an exploration of both the intimacy and complexity inherent in each interaction, as reflected in the gradual transition from a whole mouth to a single tooth.</p>
